### Aleksander Wo≈∫niak, 25
Hello, I'm a Software Engineer, Automatics and Robotics graduate hungry for
knowledge. Passionate about technology and possibilities it creates.

I enjoy trying new things, cooking (and eating) tasty stuff, travelling to beautiful places
preferably in the company of a group of friends *(I'll be the driver though)*.

Interested in smart finance management, leading a fun and creative life,
creating content and exploring new opportunities that XXI century throws at me.

Working at [*ReasonApps*](https://reasonapps.pl) with some good friends.

Always looking for new adventures.
